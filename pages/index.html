        The ActiveCampaign Sync application allows for automatic synchronization
        of information between Google Sheets™ and the ActiveCampaign™ platform.
        With this tool, it's possible to map Google Sheets™ fields with custom
        fields in ActiveCampaign™, allowing information to be updated in
        real-time.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use the application, it's necessary to configure the URL and API
        token of ActiveCampaign™, as well as selecting the leads list and email
        column in Google Sheets™. Then, it's possible to map add-on columns with
        custom fields in ActiveCampaign™ such as utm_campaign, utm_source,
        utm_medium, utm_content, and utm_term.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application also offers connection testing functionality with
        ActiveCampaign™ and the ability to view available leads lists and custom
        fields in the platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, the application includes a customized menu in Google
        Sheets™ and can be easily configured and personalized by the user.
        Automatic synchronization is performed through a trigger that is
        activated whenever a new form is submitted to Google Sheets™.
      </p>

      <p>
        With ActiveCampaign Sync, it's possible to automate marketing and sales
        processes, saving time and increasing team productivity.
